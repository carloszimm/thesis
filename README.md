# Unveiling the Usability of Reactive Programming APIs: Findings, Tools, and Recommendations

This repository concentrates all the scripts and materials used for the elaboration and results of the thesis "Unveiling the Usability of Reactive Programming APIs: Findings, Tools, and Recommendations"

## Mining Study
The mining study was developed and published as part of the following paper during the 19th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR '22):
> Mining the Usage of Reactive Programming APIs: A Mining Study on GitHub and Stack Overflow.

The scripts and supporting materials used in the work are then available in:
* [GitHub Mining](https://github.com/carloszimm/gh-mining-msr22)
* [Stack Overflow Mining](https://github.com/carloszimm/so-mining-msr22)
* [Operators Scraping](https://github.com/carloszimm/rx-scraping-msr22)

### Forks checking
 Additionally, we created an additional script (available at `/forks-checking`) to check for the presence of forks in the explored repositories of [GitHub Mining](https://github.com/carloszimm/gh-mining-msr22). More information about how to execute it can be here [forks-checking](https://github.com/carloszimm/thesis/tree/main/mining_study/forks-checking).

## Mixed-methods Study
The mining study was developed and submitted (to the [Software: Practice and Experience](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1097024x) Journal) as part of the paper titled:
> On the Usability of Reactive Programming APIs: A Mixed Evaluation

The scripts and supporting materials used in the work are available in:
* [Journal Repository](https://github.com/carloszimm/reactiveusability24)

## Software Archive
All the repositories, this one included, were archived through the [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org) service.
