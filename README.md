# Unveiling the Usability of Reactive Programming APIs: Findings, Tools, and Recommendations

This repository concentrates all the scripts and materials used for the elaboration and results of the thesis "Unveiling the Usability of Reactive Programming APIs: Findings, Tools, and Recommendations"

## Mining Study
The mining study (Chapter 3 - Mining the Usage of Reactive Programming APIs on GitHub and Stack Overflow) was developed and published as part of the following paper during the 19th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR '22):
> [Mining the Usage of Reactive Programming APIs: A Mining Study on GitHub and Stack Overflow](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3524842.3527966)

The scripts and supporting materials used in the work are then available in:
* [GitHub Mining](https://github.com/carloszimm/gh-mining-msr22)
* [Stack Overflow Mining](https://github.com/carloszimm/so-mining-msr22)
* [Operators Scraping](https://github.com/carloszimm/rx-scraping-msr22)

### Forks checking
 Additionally, we created an additional script (available at `/mining_study/forks-checking`) to check for the presence of forks in the explored repositories of [GitHub Mining](https://github.com/carloszimm/gh-mining-msr22). More information about how to execute it can be here [forks-checking](https://github.com/carloszimm/thesis/tree/main/mining_study/forks-checking).

## Mixed-methods Study
The mixed-methods study (Chapter 4 - Evaluating the Usability of Reactive Programming APIs through a Mixed-methods Study) was developed and submitted (to the [Software: Practice and Experience](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1097024x) Journal) as part of the article titled:
> On the Usability of Reactive Programming APIs: A Mixed Evaluation

The scripts and supporting materials used in the work are available in:
* [Journal Repository](https://github.com/carloszimm/reactiveusability24)

### UAX tool
The UAX (Usability Analyzer Experience) was developed in part during the production of the above article, but details about its implementation including a demonstration with three reactive programming libraries are available in the following paper published at the XXXVIII Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering:
> [UAX: Measuring the Usability of TypeScript APIs](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sbes/article/view/30429)

The UAX repositories are available at:
* [UAX main tool](https://github.com/uax-analyzer/uax)
* [UAX dashboard](https://github.com/uax-analyzer/uax-ui)

## Software Archive
All the repositories, this one included, were archived through the [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org) service.
